						When Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen, was exhibited for the first time in 1881, “Paris could scarcely maintain its equilibrium,” Mrs. Havemeyer, a viewer of the sculpture, recalled.  “The result is almost frightening,” wrote Paul Mantz, a former Director-General of Fine Arts for the Exhibition for Independent Artists in 1881.  Although he was well versed in realism and recognized “the singular truthfulness of the overall movement,” to him, Little Dancer was something else altogether. Outraged, he vilified “the instinctive ugliness of a face on which all the vices imprint their detestable promises.”  The fact that the figure was made of wax, clay, old paint brushes, organic material, wood, human hair, commercial slippers, wire, tulle, ribbon, and linen caused some peers to question the statuette’s status as art at all, analogizing it to “dummies in hairdressers’ windows,” puppets and dolls, and scientific specimens that belonged in a “museum of zoology.”  Notable critic Joris Karl Huysmans, while equally shocked, was more generous: “This statuette is the only real attempt at modernity in sculpture that I know… The fact is that, in one stroke, Mr. Degas has overturned the traditions of sculpture, just as he has long since shaken the conventions of painting.” 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Little Dancer, which was modelled in wax in 1880, is perhaps Edgar Degas’ most famous sculpture, and despite its seminal role in shaping modern art, it nearly failed make it out of the 19th century. Found disintegrating and in pieces in Degas’ studio following his death, the sculpture was salvaged and cast in bronze at least two dozen times from 1920 to 1936 by the Hébrard foundry.  Standing at 39 inches and adorned with a tulle skirt and ribbon, the figure on display at the Fogg is the third of the Hébrard bronzes.  It shows a young, prepubescent ballet dancer standing in open fourth position, hands behind her back, chin up. No stranger to the Paris Opera Ballet, Degas was well known for his faithful depiction of ballet dancers behind-the-scenes, an insight into imperfection afforded few. In Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen, Degas creates a liminal space between the real and the ideal. He places us in the middle of this tension to comment on the realities late 19th century French ballet dancers faced, the decline of the Paris Opera and the role of ballet in high society, as well as the changing tastes of the Parisian art scene.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						At a glance, Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen is delicate and feminine. Up close, however, she is ugly. While her unexamined form seems balletic, the details tell a different narrative. Her legs are emaciated, about as wide her arms. Her chest caves, her shoulders roll in, and her neck collapses, as if a shiver is running down her spine, or she is atrophying. Her forehead noticeably lacks a defined brow bone. Her mouth protrudes, almost simian in its exaggeration. Her bottom foot pronates. Her legs hyperextend, twist, then disappear beneath a tulle skirt significantly fuller than her hips. Her skin is mottled, the skirt’s edges are frayed, and the ribbon is raw.  The greenish-yellow hue of both the linen and the patina lends the entire ensemble an air of jaundice.  At stark odds with the idealized notion of the triumphant classical ballerina popular in French high culture, Little Dancer’s tone seems, at first, conceivably the result of many minute discrepancies between Degas’ subject (The Ballerina) and its execution. And yet, given Degas’ habit of crystal accuracy, we know that none of this could have been a mistake. Starting in the 1860s, Degas became a frequent patron and friend of the Paris Opera Ballet, spending significant amounts of time observing ballet dancers in rehearsal and transferring his immediate visual experience, so highly dependent on the most minute of muscle flexes, to paper.  Later on, he also developed extended working relationships with several individual dancers, whom he would call on regularly for modelling gigs. Little Dancer was one such extended, solo-modelled project, and its form was sketched meticulously dozens of times.  Some of the earliest sketches (see Figure 1) depict a normal-looking girl with athletically endowed legs and resting posture. Later drawings (see Figures 2 and 3) become more contorted, reflecting changes to the shoulders, placement of the arms, shape of the nose, and limb contours. Alterations resulting in the dramatic tilt of the head are not captured in any of the sketches. Instead, they must have been worked directly onto the wax model; the National Gallery of Art’s radiograph analysis (see Figure 4) shows that in order to compensate for this physiognomic embodiment of vice, Degas was forced to add four centimeters’ worth of wax to elevate the figure’s shoulders.  It was not out of accident that Degas failed to convey the ethereal qualities of ballet; it was out of contrivance and accommodation that he managed to tease out all the mundanity of a professional doing a job. This effort would not have gone completely unnoticed by his audience. They, too, would have been the type to patronize the Opéra Garnier and would have been familiar with (or at least somewhat receptive to) this intentionality of form. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Even amid the context of an entrenched realist movement away from the classical Greek notions of unity, impassivity, universality, eternity, beauty, and publicity and toward the fragmentary, the expressive, the individual, the contemporary, the ugly, and the private, Degas’ statuette was revolutionary. To begin with, it was a sculpture, not a painting. In French art critic circles, the very idea of the modern sculpture met resistance. Between neoclassical marble figures epitomizing the composite of every human ideal and dolls satisfying primitive fetishes, there existed little to soothe the dichotomy.  The notion of reinventing sculpture as a modern medium, then, was a dangerous one fraught with moral weight, and hostile judgment ensued.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						To offer a concrete look into what the transition from classicism to realism looked like, we will bring Michelangelo’s David into comparison with Little Dancer. At 17 feet tall, David (from the triumphant Bible story of David and Goliath) is mythic in both subject and proportion.  Little Dancer, on the other hand, stands just over 3 feet tall, and depicts an actual girl, neither heroic nor famous nor courageous, but rather, treated with suspicion. Her ethnic face is imprinted atavistically with the marks of low breeding and crime, and her disobedient posture  reinforces her failure to meet ballet’s exacting standards of grace and carriage. David’s face is Grecian, with a high brow bone, straight nose, and chiseled jawline. He is sculpted from smooth white marble that withstands weather and time; she is molded from wax died yellow-brown, and although she is kept in a box, she soon breaks. His story invokes the universality of religion and human struggle; hers inspires not sympathy, but blame for contemporary social ill. He looks determined; she looks fatigued. He stands relaxed and firm as he meets his match; she seems to have already met her match. He is a man; she is not even a woman. He is impossibly beautiful; she is forgettable. While David epitomizes classical sculpture’s public role in memorializing and promoting societally held values, Little Dancer offers little clarity on who is to blame for her condition and instead dances awkwardly around a complex, non-binary issue.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Degas was not the only late 19th century artist working in the space of uncomfortable realism. One year prior to Little Dancer’s first sketch, Auguste Rodin, often called the father of sculptural realism, had already exhibited The Vanquished, a controversial modern bronze cast of a man awakening to suffering that was scandalized for its extreme naturalism.  Despite their mutual interest in displaying the imperfect realities of modern life, the two artists still had substantive differences in style. In the decade prior, (1872-6), the Parisian art scene had experienced a resurgence of Michelangelo’s style in French sculpture, called sculptural Florentinism.  While Rodin was heavily influenced by this revival, Degas more closely followed another classicist—Poussin—known for his empirical exploration of mechanism against Michelangelo’s hyperbolic display of vitalism.  Poussin’s relative commitment to scientific precision and proportion enabled Degas to move, perhaps more so than Rodin, radically away from the core ideas of classicism. 					
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						In order to understand this difference, we can compare the output of each artist in 1881: Rodin’s Eve, inspired by Michelangelo’s fresco Expulsion from Paradise, and Degas’ Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen, inspired perhaps by the generalized works of Poussin, who, among classical artists, most intensely reworked the theme of dance and produced no less than 12 compositions on the subject.  Eve stands 5 feet 7 inches tall, cast in a glossy, dark bronze.  She hunches over, her arms wrapped around her chest, one hand blocking her face. While Eve approaches realism in the mottled texture of the bronze and her figure’s ugly lumps of fat, Rodin still falls back on the classical use of exaggerated contrapposto, large size, Biblical narratives, and melodic, exaggerated curves to translate a narrative of emotion and energy. It is a neoclassical bronze cast attempting to convince us that it is also realist.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Despite being made of the same material, the bronze cast of Little Dancer has a different effect. While bronze is a strong medium that allows for a wide range of physiognomic freedom, Degas opts not to capitalize on it. Instead, working at a small size in fragile wax (compared to Rodin’s more durable plaster model) initially, he tweaks the armature continuously, ensuring impeccable anatomical logic subservient to the laws of physics.  The fact that the statuette is bronze is merely the Hébrards’ afterthought in the service of preservation; his work is not made realist by the medium, but rather, in spite of it.   It is a realist statue attempting to hide the fact that it is a bronze cast beneath linens and texture and color. Unlike in Eve, in which feeling is produced by melodramatic exaggeration of form (unreality), the feeling of Little Dancer is produced by the sheer mechanical, biological determinism (reality) of her face, which contemporary critics like Elie de Mont compared to that of a monkey or an Aztec, “synonyms of the initial states of human evolution.”  If some form of primitivism was the object of both pieces, it was done in Eve through the symbolic drama of active contortion, while in Little Dancer, it was infused into the pseudoscience of her immutably flat brow bone, forward-protruding mouth, and gently atrophying musculature.					
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Rodin, as the trailblazer of modern sculpture, still must cite the classical in order to legitimize his constructed space of realism. He maintains the institutional idea that sculpture ought to depict some universal human generality (in Eve’s case: suffering, betrayal, shame), if not in ideal physiognomy, then in abstract energy. Degas, on the other hand, does not seem to feel the need to make this comparison. Instead of classical narratives like Biblical scenes, he is able to reference a more contemporary cultural stronghold—ballet—as a legitimizing subject and allow realism to take form in the mundane individualism of the sculpture’s very essence as well.					
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Perhaps Degas was able to leverage ballet’s appeal as a subject because of its historical importance to French pride—the dance form stemmed from the country’s own imperial, cultural peak. Introduced to the royal court under King Henry II in the 1500s and popularized by King Louis XIV well into the early 1700s, ballet was a highly respected art codified in the French language.  Unlike theater, it was not below the King to participate in ballet himself.  Ballet was the moving embodiment of ideal human form. By Degas’ prime, however, the French ballet had fallen into serious decline, overtaken by the Russian ballet.  Throughout the mid 1800s, the French Opera Ballet experienced turmoil as their Opéra inexplicably burnt down twice and had to be rebuilt.  Star directors, like Marius Pepita—often considered the most influential ballet master and choreographer in ballet history, left for the Russian Imperial Ballet (precursor to the Kirov/Mariinsky), going on to produce many of ballet’s most famous works, including Don Quixote, La Bayadére, The Sleeping Beauty, and The Nutcracker.  As the French ballet came to be seen as a divertissement rather than a respectable art form, the composition of the company came to resemble that of the theater. Many young dancers were poor street urchins for whom ballet was a grueling livelihood. Commonly referred to as Opéra rats, most burnt out early, solicited wealthy male patrons, and did not last long within the company.  Taking into account the history of the French ballet’s changing social status, Little Dancer, along with other works by Degas, can be thought of as commentary on the denigration of the once-ideal art of ballet. Well-dressed, top-hatted male patrons are a repeated character in many of his paintings. In depicting the distasteful reality of the voyeur within art, perhaps he is also commenting on the changing nature of his own audience.					
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						And indeed, Little Dancer poses quite the challenge to a layman gallery audience. Without significant ballet exposure or training, viewers are slow to notice the discrepancies between Little Dancer in her real form and our minds' idealized conception of the Ballerina. The figure’s raised head is initially reminiscent of a disciplined order to lift the chin, but after a second, you notice that instead of elongating her entire neck, she allows it to collapse in the back, as if her head is being pulled backward by the ponytail, rather than held by some internal force of will. The rolled forward shoulders and caved chest reveal relaxation, deviation, fatigue, and perhaps a weakening of will. Everything is atrophying, like how when you hold a pose for a portrait too long, it loses its essence, becoming suddenly disfigured and grotesque. The turn out, too, is merely a facsimile of ideal ballet form. Her bottom foot is pronating, arch collapsing. Her bottom knee isn't actually turned out, but rather pointing in. She is in the classic cheater position, where the foot is turned out by twisting the weaker, injury-prone, but more flexible ankle, rather than the hip. This gives illusion of turnout with much less effort. At an amateur's understanding of ballet, it has the same satisfying winging effect on the line.					
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						The implied line created by the structured bodice also serves to delay our understanding of Little Dancer's dismal fate. The performance bodice features a peplum flare around the hips, which juts out above the high-volume tulle skirt and creates the illusion of a woman's form, even when we know from the twiggishness of her limbs and torso that we are looking at a prepubescent, undernourished girl.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Because the silhouette and the general form are dainty and balletic, it is very easy for the nonchalant viewer to quickly pass over the details that truly tell her narrative, to overlook how she actually is, how she actually feels. If we pass by too quickly, we fill in the blanks with the implied line, the classical vision that we want her to be or assume she is. In this way, Little Dancer is at risk of not being seen. Without active effort on the part of the viewer, she receives only attention, and not individual sympathy.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Fittingly, the real-life model for Little Dancer was one of the poverty-stricken Opéra rats: Marie Van Goethem, a young Belgian dancer transitioning from childhood to professionalism and competing for a spot at the lowest level on the ballet ladder, was one of three sisters who’d all been recruited for the corps.  Their mother, a nightclub entertainer, prostituted them to wealthy “protectors” until they were kicked out of the Paris Opéra not long after posing for Degas.  Their offense? Robbing 700 francs from one of their “protectors.”  This story was not out of the ordinary. Rats were characterized by low birth and were popularly thought to embody many of the vices and criminal tendencies attenuated to the lower classes of the theater world. Far from the strong, elegant, ideal vision of the ballerina, Marie was seen in shockingly individual and contemporary terms as a crude, insolent sexual predator, as ambitious as she was frail.  Much like Marie Van Goethem, Little Dancer the sculpture begs to be seen and heard as a person rather than an idea, and she has the physical spectators, but not the agency to make herself understood.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Rather than shying away from this complex tension between voyeur and solicitor, Little Dancer invokes it as another uncomfortable contemporary reality to be grappled with. Within the gallery, is Little Dancer enticing the viewer or being exploited? What about on the streets outside the Opéra Garnier? Who is the predator and who is the prey? By letting us into the offstage practice tied inextricably to the onstage performance, Degas complicates the ideal with the real, both in ballet and in sculpture.
